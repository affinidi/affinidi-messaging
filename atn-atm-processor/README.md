# ATN-ATM Processor

A service that handles messages addressed directly to the ATM itself, these are protocol level messages that can potentially
modify the state of the ATM (I.e. modify allow/deny lists, resource limits, discovery etc)

A work in progress, may not work at all depending on what hacking Glenn is up to... :)
