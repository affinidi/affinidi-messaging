# Affinidi Trust Network - Affinidi Trusted Messaging

## Changelog history

Why are there skipped version numbers? Sometimes when deploying via CI/CD Pipeline we find little issues that only affect deployment.
Missing versions on the changelog simply reflect minor deployment changes on our tooling.
